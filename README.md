# MazeRPG
RPG Maze Project

Allows user to generate and navigate a randomly generated maze. One version is just the maze, the other version is a Door and Key maze, which generates keys you have to find to open doors in your path.

Improvements needed: Code cleaning, moving keys (maybe battling to retrieve keys)
